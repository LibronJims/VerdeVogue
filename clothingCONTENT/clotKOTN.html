                    Modeled after a traditional French chore coat, this jacket has three patch pockets and a soft indigo blue colour. 
                    Its sanded and pre-washed for maximum softness, and the carefully placed details of white paint drops 
                    give it a lived-in feel right off the bat.

                    Overview of Kotn

                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kotn began with an environmentally friendly fashion vision in 2015. Who owns Kotn? Rami Helali, Benjamin Sehl, 
                    and Mackenzie Yeates are the Kotn founders who work with groups to ensure ethical labour practices within their 
                    manufacturing process. <br> <br>

                    Kotn is extremely transparent on where they source their cotton. Grown in the Nile Delta in Egypt, it’s 100% 
                    organic cotton. The brand uses this fiber for numerous fabrics, ranging from jersey knits to textured jacquard.
                    <br><br> 

                    “Buying the raw material ourselves lets us do three things: provide our customers with fair prices that reflect 
                    the quality instead of the label, provide farmers with better prices and business practices (especially in comparison 
                    to fast fashion enterprises), provide transparency into how our partners conduct their business,” Kotn states.

                    Kotn also works with an NGO in Egypt to ensure that every child within their farming communities has access 
                    to education. With each purchase, all orders are used to help fund the operations of school infrastructure, 
                    salaries for teachers, technology, maintenance for roads, and so forth.
