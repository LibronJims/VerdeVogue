                    Over the past few years, ILIA Beauty has built a massive following, in part due to its unique approach to makeup and beauty as a whole. 
                    According to its website, ILIA believes in "skincare-powered makeup," which is why its products are powered by active skincare 
                    ingredients to nourish, protect, and shield skin. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Today, the Los Angeles-based brand—which was founded by Sasha Plavsic in 2011 —carries eye, lip, and face makeup (along with a handful of multipurpose products) 
                    in a wide variety of shades that'll cost you anywhere between $26 and $52.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    ILIA is also committed to sustainability. On its website, the company claims it utilizes "recycled aluminum, glass components, and responsibly sourced paper" 
                    in its packaging. <a href="https://iliabeauty.com/pages/recycling?nrtv_cid=.nrtv_plchldr.&nrtv_as_src=1"> <b>also teamed up with TerraCycle</b> </a> to invite 
                    customers to mail back empty beauty products — to be broken down responsibly — via a prepaid shipping label. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While I was already familiar with the ILIA Beauty brand before writing this piece, their team was kind enough to send me some of their best-selling products to test out first-hand.

                    Admittedly, one coat of ILIA's Limitless Lash Mascara doesn't add much length to your lashes. However, the real magic occurs once you swipe on a second coat: Expect fanned-out, 
                    luscious lashes that'll last for hours on end. The dual-sided wand effectively separates, curls, and coats lashes without flaking, smudging, or fading. Plus, its 99 percent
                     naturally derived formula features good-for-you ingredients like keratin and shea butter, along with conditioning bee and carnauba waxes.

                    Ilia's Super Serum Skin Tint, which comes in 30 (!) shades, is among its most popular products. Not only did my skin look and feel dewy, but the lightweight formula didn't 
                    weigh my skin down or make it look or feel cakey (a personal pet peeve). Remember, a little goes a long way: I applied just six drops on my entire face before rubbing it in 
                    with my hands.

                <p>
                    I'm a huge fan of multi-purpose beauty products, so I was incredibly excited to try ILIA's Multi-Stick, which can be applied to the eyes, lips, and cheeks. While 
                    the product appears super pigmented, it's actually incredibly sheer. However, it does offer buildable coverage. The bottom line: If you want bold, vibrant color, 
                    you'll need to keep piling on the product until you achieve your desired look.

                    After using my fingers to dab a few dots of this gel-based highlighter onto my cheekbones, cupid's bow, and brow bone, I was pleasantly surprised at the radiant results. 
                    The liquid formula appeared to have almost instantly "melted" into my skin, leaving me with a smooth, natural-looking finish that's now lasted over eight hours and counting.

                    ILIA's Liquid Power Chromatic Eye Tints come in eight pigment-packed shades, and each offers a gorgeous metallic sheen. The fast-drying, non-sticky, and water-based formula — 
                    which is 99% naturally derived and packed with antioxidants — has yet to crease or smudge after over eight hours of wear. Opt for a more natural look by using your finger to 
                    blend out the pigment. Alternatively, for a deeper, darker hue, simply add a few extra coats.

                <p>
                    ILIA's Color Block High Impact Lipstick comes in 15 shades. Cinnabar is my personal favorite, since it delivers a punch of color without being too overpowering. Plus, it has a 
                    subtle sparkle in the sunlight. After letting it sit on my lips for a few minutes, I drank from my water bottle as per usual. While a bit of color came off, my lipstick 
                    looked the same: A win in my book.

                    Cons to Consider
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    First and foremost: ILIA Beauty products are somewhat costly. The cheapest full-sized product (the mascara) retails for $26, while the most expensive (a serum) 
                    is just over $50. So, it's certainly safe to say the brand isn't the most budget-friendly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It's also worth noting that the brand uses the term "clean" to describe its mission and its products. However, this can be quite confusing for consumers, 
                    as there is no set definition of what makes a beauty product or brand "clean." (ICYMI, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLaBxvXFyRM/"> <b>this Instagram post</b> </a>
                    breaks it down really well.)
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>
                    The bottom line
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While ILIA's products are costly, the company certainly delivers when it comes to quality. What's more, the brand's skincare-first approach to beauty — 
                    as well as its commitment to sustainability and use of natural, nourishing ingredients — sets it apart from competitors.
